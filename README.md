###### Quick Notes
> 💡 Prefer a local experience? While the cloud version works everywhere, cloning the repo allows for **better root access** and is recommended for **heavier or system-level tasks**.

> 🛠️ You can also **customize and redirect ScriptGrab to your own GitHub repo**, making it perfect for internal tools, private scripts, or team-specific setups.

> ⚠️ **Shell scripts can be powerful and risky.** Even small scripts can cause serious damage if misused. I strongly recommend **cloning this repo or creating your own fork** if you're cautious, especially for production environments. Or stay on the official repo to ensure you’re using trusted, reviewed code.
